## Instructions

- Clone your forked repository to your pc ( git clone "url from clone option".)
- Create a new branch for your modifications (ie. `git branch new-user` and check it out `git checkout new-user` or simply do `git checkout -b new-user`)
- Do the changes 
- Create a pull request

```
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
